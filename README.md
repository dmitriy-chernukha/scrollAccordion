# React Native Scroll Accordion

This repo implements an accordion style navigation element within a react native scrollview. The navigation consists of 3 touts which, when clicked, reveal their subcategories. The scrollview scrolls to the appropriate location on click such that the tout is at the top of the device viewport, and the links are below them. 

## Installation

This repo was built using React Native's standard [Getting Startde](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) instructions. There is a lot of initial overhead involved with doing this. If you'd rather just see a working example, [Exponent](https://expo.io/) has a great JS-Fiddle / Codepen style editor called [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/), where I have built a [stripped-down version of this app](https://snack.expo.io/S1VjFU-Rx) which may be far easier to understand. 

The code is well commented, but email me if you have any questions or improvements!
